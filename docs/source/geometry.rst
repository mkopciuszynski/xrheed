xRHEED geometry
=======================

The geometry used in the xrheed software is shown in the sketch below.

It is important to note that, for convenience, we use two coordinate systems. 
The x-y-z system is centered at the sample position (with z normal to the sample surface). 
On the RHEED screen, X-Y coordinates are defined with the Y direction pointing upward, which means that the RHEED image appears for negative Y values, below the X axis, as is typical in a RHEED geometry with the sample facing downward (for example, towards effusion cells).

Two angles are also used to define the setup conditions:

- $$\alpha$$ - azimuthal orientation of the sample
- $$\beta$$ - incident angle of the electron beam (with respect to the x axis)
