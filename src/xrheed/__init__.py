"""
xRHEED: An xarray-based toolkit for RHEED image analysis.

This package provides tools to:
- Load and preprocess RHEED images
- Extract and analyze intensity profiles
- Transform images to kx-ky space
- Predict and visualize diffraction spot positions using kinematic theory and Ewald construction

xRHEED is designed as an **xarray accessory library** for interactive analysis
in environments such as Jupyter notebooks. It is **not a GUI application**.
